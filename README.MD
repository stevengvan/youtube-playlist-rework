# Youtube Playlist Rework

This is an app that allows users to stream any playlist they want. It is a Progressive web app project that utilizes Google's Youtube player API and OAuth 2.0 protocol. Features such as sign in/out, dark mode toggle, and additional player controls are included in this application. This project was made to speed up the process of shuffling a playlist on a larger playlist (similarly to how Youtube's mobile app shuffles a playlist).

## Local Testing

To test locally, the following items must be completed beforehand:

- Create a Google Cloud account: [Sign up from here](https://cloud.google.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=na-US-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-e-dr-1605212&utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_665665924735-ADGP_Hybrid+%7C+BKWS+-+MIX+%7C+Txt_Google+Cloud+General-KWID_43700077212109166-kwd-173795742258&utm_term=KW_google+cloud+sign+up-ST_google+cloud+sign+up&gclid=Cj0KCQjwj5mpBhDJARIsAOVjBdrNW62_53Btpkt5A7iaclFu4Mo5H6-FK7RMfgm8LOh4my7TSW45Jk0aArcvEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&hl=en)

- Create an API key to use Youtube player API: [How to setup API keys](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862?hl=en)

- Get an OAuth 2.0 client ID: [Setting up OAuth 2.0](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en)

When setting up the API key and OAuth 2.0, it is recommended to add restrictions on what API can be used or limit where the API can be used (this can be done while creating both items). Additionally a .env file should be created to store the API key.
